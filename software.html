    <h1>What is a software</h1>
    <p>Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or 
       computer instructions that tell the compute r how to work. This is 
       in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and 
       actually performs the work . In computer science and software engineering, computer
       software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. 
       Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable 
       data, such as online documentation or digital media.

    <h2>Types of software</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Application software</li>
        <li>System software</li>
        <li>Malicious software or malware</li>

    <h3>Operating systems</h3>
    <p>
    which are essential collections of software that manage resources
    and provides common services for other software that runs "on top"
    of them. Supervisory programs, boot loaders, shells and window
    systems are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating
    system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) 
    so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that 
    only has one operating system.

    <h3>Device drivers</h3>
    <p>
    which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached 
    to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device 
    driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input 
    device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more 
    than one device driver.

<div id="system3">
    <h3>Utilities</h3>
    <p>
    which are computer programs designed to assist users in the 
    maintenance and care of their computers.
