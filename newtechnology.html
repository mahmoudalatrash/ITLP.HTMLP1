        <h1>The top 4 technology trends predicted to reach adoption in 2019 are:</h1>
        <div id="tech1">
            <h2>Deep learning accelerators</h2>
            <p>
                such as GPUs, FPGAs, and more recently TPUs. More companies have
                been announcing plans to design their own accelerators, which are
                widely used in data centers. There is also an opportunity to
                deploy them at the edge, initially for inference and for limited 
                training over time. This also includes accelerators for very low 
                power devices. The development of these technologies will allow 
                machine learning (or smart devices) to be used in many IoT devices 
                and appliances.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tech2">
            <h2>Assisted transportation</h2>
            <p>
            While the vision of fully autonomous, self-driving vehicles might 
            still be a few years away, increasingly automated assistance is 
            taking place in both personal and municipal (dedicated) vehicles. 
            Assisted transportation is already very useful in terms of wide 
            recognition and is paving the way for fully autonomous vehicles. 
            This technology is highly dependent on deep learning accelerators 
            (see #1) for video recognition. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tech3">
            <h2>The Internet of Bodies (IoB)</h2>
            <p>
            IoT and self-monitoring technologies are moving closer to and even 
            inside the human body. Consumers are comfortable with self-tracking 
            using external devices (such as fitness trackers and smart glasses) 
            and with playing games using augmented reality devices. Digital pills 
            are entering mainstream medicine, and body-attached, implantable, and 
            embedded IoB devices are also beginning to interact with sensors in 
            the environment. These devices yield richer data that enable more 
            interesting and useful applications, but also raise concerns about 
            security, privacy, physical harm, and abuse.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tech4">
            <h2>Social credit algorithms</h2>
            <p>
            These algorithms use facial recognition and other advanced biometrics 
            to identify a person and retrieve data about that person from social 
            media and other digital profiles for the purpose of approval or denial 
            of access to consumer products or social services. In our increasingly 
            networked world, the combination of biometrics and blended social data 
            streams can turn a brief observation into a judgment of whether a person
            is a good or bad risk or worthy of public social sanction. Some countries
            are reportedly already using social credit algorithms to assess loyalty 
            to the state.
